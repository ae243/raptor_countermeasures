\section{Conclusion}

In this work, we have presented countermeasures to active BGP routing attacks that can be launched by network-level adversaries. 
% In particular, our proposed countermeasures target routing manipulations such as BGP prefix hijack and interception attacks.  

First, we evaluated the Tor network for it's current state of resilience to hijack and interception attacks.  
We observed that some ASes with high Tor bandwidth only have relatively low resilience.  Next, we presented proactive countermeasures that include a new Tor guard relay selection algorithm. The algorithm successfully reduces the probability of a Tor client being affected by a prefix hijack attack, and protects the security and anonymity of the Tor clients at the same time. Finally, we presented a live monitoring framework that can detect routing anomalies in Tor relays in real time. 

Overall, our work ...
