\section{Conclusion}

In this work, we have presented countermeasures to safeguard Tor against active BGP routing attacks.
% In particular, our proposed countermeasures target routing manipulations such as BGP prefix hijack and interception attacks.  

First, we evaluated the Tor network for its current state of resilience to hijack and interception attacks.  
We observed that some ASes with high Tor bandwidth have relatively low resilience.  Next, we presented proactive countermeasures that include a new Tor guard relay selection algorithm. The algorithm successfully reduces the probability of a Tor client being affected by a prefix hijack attack, and at the same time protects the security and anonymity of the Tor client. Finally, we presented a live monitoring system that can detect routing anomalies in Tor relays in real time. 

Overall, our work is the first work on mitigating active routing attacks on Tor.
