% TEMPLATE for Usenix papers, specifically to meet requirements of
%  USENIX '05
% originally a template for producing IEEE-format articles using LaTeX.
%   written by Matthew Ward, CS Department, Worcester Polytechnic Institute.
% adapted by David Beazley for his excellent SWIG paper in Proceedings,
%   Tcl 96
% turned into a smartass generic template by De Clarke, with thanks to
%   both the above pioneers
% use at your own risk.  Complaints to /dev/null.
% make it two column with no page numbering, default is 10 point

% Munged by Fred Douglis <douglis@research.att.com> 10/97 to separate
% the .sty file from the LaTeX source template, so that people can
% more easily include the .sty file into an existing document.  Also
% changed to more closely follow the style guidelines as represented
% by the Word sample file. 

% Note that since 2010, USENIX does not require endnotes. If you want
% foot of page notes, don't include the endnotes package in the 
% usepackage command, below.

% This version uses the latex2e styles, not the very ancient 2.09 stuff.

\subsection*{Abstract}
Tor is a widely-used anonymity system, but has also been shown to be vulnerable to 
different types of traffic analysis attacks.  Recently, experiments have shown that 
Tor is susceptible to asymmetric traffic analysis attacks, as well as other attacks 
at the AS level.  These include malicious manipulations of traffic such as BGP prefix 
hijack and interception attacks.  
This paper presents a new evaluation of how resilient the Tor network is to prefix 
hijack attacks.  We also present a set of novel countermeasures that will help 
prevent these types of attacks from being successful: a new path selection algorithm, 
a live monitoring framework that uses a variety of heuristics for attack detection, and 
suggestions for Tor relay operators.
