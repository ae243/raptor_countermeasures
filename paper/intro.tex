\section{Problem Motivation}

Tor is a wildly used system for anonymous communications. However, Tor is known to be vulnerable to traffic correlation attacks in which an adversary can correlate the traffic at both ends of the communication to deanonymize the users. Recently, researchers have shown that AS-level adversaries can exploit the dynamics of BGP routing and launch new attacks on Tor \cite{sun2015raptor}, including both passive attacks exploiting routing asymmetry and natural churn, as well as active attacks with BGP prefix hijacking/interception. Thus, these new attacks urge the need to build countermeasures to defend Tor against such malicious AS-level adversaries. In this work, we will focus on developing countermeasures against active BGP routing attacks. 

There are two potential ways to counter the attacks: (1) Mitigating traffic interception, and (2) Mitigating correlation attacks. However, mitigating correlation attacks usually involve employing extra encryption schemes and/or packet obfuscation, which either requires lots of engineering efforts, or could result in high latency of Tor. Thus, given the constraints of mitigating correlation attacks, we will build countermeasures that focus on mitigating traffic interception, more specifically, against active BGP routing attacks. Our approach includes two parts, as following.
