% TEMPLATE for Usenix papers, specifically to meet requirements of
%  USENIX '05
% originally a template for producing IEEE-format articles using LaTeX.
%   written by Matthew Ward, CS Department, Worcester Polytechnic Institute.
% adapted by David Beazley for his excellent SWIG paper in Proceedings,
%   Tcl 96
% turned into a smartass generic template by De Clarke, with thanks to
%   both the above pioneers
% use at your own risk.  Complaints to /dev/null.
% make it two column with no page numbering, default is 10 point

% Munged by Fred Douglis <douglis@research.att.com> 10/97 to separate
% the .sty file from the LaTeX source template, so that people can
% more easily include the .sty file into an existing document.  Also
% changed to more closely follow the style guidelines as represented
% by the Word sample file. 

% Note that since 2010, USENIX does not require endnotes. If you want
% foot of page notes, don't include the endnotes package in the 
% usepackage command, below.

% This version uses the latex2e styles, not the very ancient 2.09 stuff.

\section{Problem Motivation}
\cite{sun2015raptor}

\section{Novel Ideas/Perspectives}
Goal: provide (effective) countermeasures against active RAPTOR attacks.

\subsection{Path Selection of Guard Relay}
-path selection against active attacks\\
-how to pick a good/close guard relay\\
-how to handle the tradeoff between resilience and privacy - for instance, picking a guard that's too far away makes the client more vulnerable to equally-specific prefix attacks, while picking a guard that's too close may reveal the location information of the client. 

\subsection{Live Monitoring Framework}
{\bf BGP Monitoring Framework}

{\bf Traceroute Monitoring Framework}

{\bf Challenges}

-monitor BGP announcements, use traceroute to verify (becomes optimization problem)\\
-use relay info to selectively monitor relays\\
-differentiate between hijacks and interceptions\\
-differentiate between attacks and legitimate announcements by multi-origin AS\\

NOTE: other ideas
-check resilience of relays to prefix hijacking (see AS resilience work)
