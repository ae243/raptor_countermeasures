\section{Notes}
Proactive approaches:
\begin{itemize}
\item Getting relays to be in a /24 instead of a larger prefix
\item Path Selection algorithm
\item Static routing (ask Nick)
\end{itemize}

Reactive/Detection approaches:
\begin{itemize}
\item Monitoring framework - how to use live BGP feed and traceroutes to detect attacks?  Evaluate false positives?  Think about the attack space on traceroutes.
\item Deployment experience - how the monitoring framework works in the real world
\end{itemize}

Measurements/Metrics/Evaluation Techniques:
\begin{itemize}
\item Resiliency wrt path selection
\item Resiliency of the Tor network in general or of specific relays (some ASes may contain more relays, so this should be taken into account when looking at resilience
\item Other possible metrics to analyze the Tor network (impact, probability) - possibly look at the probability of "normal" (non-Tor) hijacks impacting the Tor network?
\end{itemize}
